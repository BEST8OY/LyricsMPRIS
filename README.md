# LyricsMPRIS

A modern Go application that fetches currently playing song metadata from MPRIS, retrieves lyrics from lrclib.net, and displays lyrics in two terminal modes:

- **Pipe mode**: Outputs the current lyric line to stdout as the song progresses.
- **Modern mode**: Shows a highlighted, scrolling lyrics view in the terminal.

## Features
- Resilient to missing metadata/lyrics (waits for next track)
- Beautiful terminal UI
- Linux support (MPRIS)

## Usage

To be updated as development progresses.
